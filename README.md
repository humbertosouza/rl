# Reinforcement Learning Sandbox

Reinforcement Learning assignments, tests and term project.

On the root are the Jupyter Notebooks.
Under the assignment folders, the python files are found.

The "Reinforcement Learning and Linear Regression for asset prediction - BTC"  assignment was developed from Python files containing existing scripts and adapted to perform with BTC data and run under the Jupyter Notebook environment.

The files contains the following:

1 - rl_stock_final_1.ipynb - The adapted Jupyter Notebook code that implements the hyperparameter exploration on BTC/USD
2 - random_rl_stock_final.ipynb - Same code adapted to use a random agent as a benchmark
3 - Binance_historic_prices_getter.ipynb - The adapted code to acquire BTC and other cryptocurrency data from Binance
4 - PowerPoint Presentation containing the results of the third run (the current Colab results shows the run of the 4th run or could be even newer as you read it)

This repository contains codes and ideas from different authors, mentioned in the files and myself based on a research made 1 year before the creation of the current repository where I explored some Machine Learning approaches.
